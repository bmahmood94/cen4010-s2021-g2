    <p>My name is Belal Mahmood. I am 26 years old, I did 4 years in the United States Marine Corps. I am pursuing a dual major bachelors in Computer Engineering and Computer Science because I thought it would be beneficial for my future. Ideally, I would like to pursue a career with the Department of Defense in the military technologies sector. Ultimately, my goal would be to have my own company that would offer cybersecurity. I enjoy outdoor activities; any activity outside I probably have done or will be willingly to do. I am very motivating and an overall happy person. </p>
